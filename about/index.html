FEED is a collective project and artist led curatorial platform. We are artists based around New Haven Connecticut.  We come together to engage inter-disciplinary modes of work, to collaborate and create new artworks, physical and digital, to produce print projects, make proposals, engage new modes of discourse, and participate in the communities we love.  FEED is a group of collaborators open to larger participation and eschewing traditional modes of authorship. At this time, FEED is  Aude Jomini, Eben Kling, Sarah Fritchey, Charli Taylor, with project-specific contributions by other artists. <br><br>
									
<strong>Aude Jomini&nbsp;</strong>is a Swiss-American artist and designer pursuing collaborative and cross-disciplinary projects in art and architecture.  In 2019, she co-curated the exhibition  <em>Perverse Furniture</em> at Artspace New Haven, a group show exploring the ramifications of the Bauhaus’s utopian philosophies in the local urban fabric. Other recent projects also aimed to disrupt disciplinary boundaries. In the pseudo-clinic<em>A Center for Adult Swaddling</em>, at <em>City-Wide Open Studios: Wellbeing</em> in 2018, Aude worked with medical professionals, artists and researchers to create an immersive participatory performance about New Haven. She holds a BFA in Painting from RISD and a M-ARCH from Yale School of Architecture. She is a Senior Associate at Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, and has served 5 years on Artspace’s Curatorial Advisory Board. She has also worked at Printed Matter Inc, Brooklyn Museum, and as a freelance designer.<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8gRV5Cuz0n0O90JzHOiCLADVfgbiAJC/view?usp=sharing">DOWNLOAD CV</a></strong> <br><br>

<strong>Sarah Fritchey&nbsp;</strong>is an independent Curator and Writer who works at the intersections of art, justice, civic engagement, memory and belonging. Her projects seek to bring different forms of exhibition making into a shared space, and link object study to storytelling, local history, site, and direct action. Driven by the philosophy that"one place understood helps us understand all places better,"she grounds her practice in acts of gathering, learning and reciprocal exchange. Approaching each project with an anti-racist anti-bias framework, Fritchey challenges white supremacy culture when it shows up in exhibition-making, scholarship, and the workplace. She centers her own identity and conversations around racial justice and social equity. Fritchey served as the Curator and Gallery Director at Artspace New Haven from 2014 to 2020, and  has curated exhibitions in museums, galleries and art non-profits around the country, including the African American Museum in Philadelphia, the Hessel Museum of Art in Hudson, NY, Sideshow Gallery in NYC, Fine Arts Gallery at York College in NYC, NYPOP Gallery in NYC, Real Art Ways in Hartford, CT, and Franklin Street Works in Stamford, CT. She has juried regional exhibitions at the New Britain Museum of American Art, and the Art and Culture Center in Hollywood, FL, and has contributed writing to Artforum.com, Hyperallergic, Art New England Magazine, Big, Red & Shiny, Artscope Magazine, and the Hartford Courant.  She serves as an advisor to the Elm City Innovation Team’s Could Be Fund, Nasty Women Connecticut, and the CT Artist Collection within the Department of Economic & Community Development for the State of Connecticut. She holds an M.A. in Curatorial Studies from the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard, a B.A. in Comparative Literature and Studio Practice from Hamilton College, and is an alum of No Longer Empty's Curatorial Lab. <strong><br><a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.sfritchey.com/home">LINK TO WEBSITE</a></strong><br><br>
									
<strong>Charli Taylor&nbsp;</strong>is an independent writer, artist and community organizer. They have co-authored several comic books with Eben Kling. They are part of New Haven Rising and UNITE HERE, and recently spent a month in Georgia canvassing and working towards political justice, equal right and voting access.<br><br>

<strong>Nick Grunerud</strong> aka <em>Underwear&nbsp;</em>is a comedian, musician, baker, and sometimes all three. &nbsp;This year he performed live at <em>Never Get To Be Cool</em> on February 21 2020, then recorded <em>CORONA, Light, The Coronavirus Musical,&nbsp;</em>an album about Covid-19. His latest releases, including <em>The Party of the Century</em>and <em>Trumpet, Tuba, Bass Clarinet,&nbsp;</em>can be found on bandcamp. Brian Slattery wrote in the New Haven Independent in 2018 that<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Nick Grunerud, is one of the most prolific musicians in New Haven. [&hellip;]He also performs steadily,[&hellip;] as he builds, manipulates, and then disassembles the songs before the audience&rsquo;s eyes [&hellip;] the music comes out of a dynamic mix of improvisation and planning, strategy and whim, to produce something catered to the audience...&rdquo;&nbsp;</em><strong>&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://nickgrunerud.bandcamp.com/">LINK TO BANDCAMP</a></strong>
